\section{Lecture Note Question 4}
\horz
Calculate $S_N f$ when $f= \sum_{k=-M}^{M} a_{k} e^{2\pi i kt}$ (such an $f$ is called a trignometric polynomial). Show that 
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{N\to \infty} S_{N} f= f
\end{equation*}
pointwise and in $L^{p}$-norm for all $1 \le p \le \infty$.
\horz

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Note that it follows by part 1 of the previous question that $S_{N}f = f$ for all $N\ge M$. Therefore we have pointwise and convergence in $L^{p}$ norm for each $1\le p \le \infty$.
\end{proof}
